# differential-geometry

This is a crate for differential-geometric calculations, like tensor calculus on manifolds etc.

Features planned for 0.1:
- Defining coordinate systems and conversions between them.
- Defining points on a manifold.
- Defining tensors; tensor addition, subtraction, outer product, inner product, contraction.
